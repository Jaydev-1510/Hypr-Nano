## Started with the schematic

I'm trying to devlelop an RPi RP2350B based SBC-like devboard with lots of features like the [Adafruit's Fruit Jam](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fruit-Jam-PCB/). It will have multiple ports (DVI over HDMI with HSTX, USB-Cs, Micro SD slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack too!). This will take RP2350B to the next level. Today I started with the schematic, here -
